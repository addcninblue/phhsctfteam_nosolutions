# Prelim Challenges for PHHS CTF/CS Team

jk, you can still come if you can't solve these :)



### What am I supposed to do?

Find the hidden flags that are strings in this format:

```
phhs{somerandomstring}
```



### Problem 1: Where's my flag

Oh no! My little brother took my flag and lost it in his pile of [crap](/wheresmyglag/wheresmyflag)! Help me recover my flag!!!



### Problem 2: Save my Bacon

I just stole a [test](/leaked-exam/tf-answers.txt) from Mr. Kuang, but he's gonna be super mad... Help me figure out which formula I need on my next math test!!



### Problem 3: Julius Caesar

“the fauLt, dear brutuS, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Find the flag in [this file](/julius-caesar/Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.png)

hint: hmmm I wonder why the capitalizations feel so weird.



### Problem 4: Simple Rop

Sometimes that one friend just loves putting in too much soda and it freaking buffer overflows.

Find the flag in [this file](/simplerop/simplerop)



### Think you got the answers?

Come to our first meeting to find out. Keep updated for the location and date!
