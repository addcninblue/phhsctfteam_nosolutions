# Prelim CTF Challenges for PHHS CTF/CS Team

jk, you can still come if you can't solve these :)
<br><br>



## What am I supposed to do?

- [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A&feature=youtu.be) describes what CTF competitions are


- For this challenge: find the hidden flags that are strings in this format:

**phhs{some_random_string}**

<br><br>



## Problems

### Problem 1: Where's my flag

Oh no! My little brother took my flag and lost it in his pile of [crap](wheresmyflag/wheresmyflag)! Help me recover my flag!!!

**[hint]** just use one command to find something

<br><br>



### Problem 2: Save my Bacon

I just stole a [test](leaked-exam/tf-answers.txt) from Mr. Kuang, but he's gonna be super mad... Help me figure out which formula I need on my next math test!!

**[hint]** [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher) would be really helpful

<br><br>



### Problem 3: Julius Caesar

“the fauLt, dear brutuS, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Find the flag in [this file](julius-caesar/Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.png)

**[hint]** hmmm I wonder why the capitalizations feel so weird (what does 'LSB' stand for?)
<br><br>



### Problem 4: Simple Rop

Sometimes that one friend just loves putting in too much soda and it freaking buffer overflows.

Find the flag in [this file](simplerop/simplerop)

**[hint]** it's a binary file fyi

<br><br>
<br><br>
