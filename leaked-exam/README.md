# Leaked Exam

### “HAAAALP! My final exams are coming up and I think I'm gonna flunk them! The test has two parts -- the first part has true-false questions and the second part has a proof. I hacked into my teacher's computer and found the answers for the first part, but can you help me find out what the second part is gonna be about?” 

hint: (not a hint) this type of behavior is not encouraged by the phhs ctf team :O
